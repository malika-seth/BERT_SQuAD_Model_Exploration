From there, it was most likely carried by Oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships. Spreading throughout the Mediterranean and Europe, the Black Death is estimated to have killed 3060% of Europe's total population. In total, the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350375 million in the 14th century. The world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century.

In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China. In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century. In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after.

As it spread to western Europe, the disease entered the region from southern Russia also.

During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. In 134849, the disease reached Antioch.

This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. Today, this is known as the Miasma theory.

The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis. The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic."}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what years were the Justinian plague prevelant in Western Roman Empire?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d2470", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "What did Francis Aidan Gasquet write about in 700 CE?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d2470", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "What did Gasquet adopt of the bubonic plague that was prevelant in the Eastern Roman Empire?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d2470", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The historian Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893 and suggested that \"it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\".
